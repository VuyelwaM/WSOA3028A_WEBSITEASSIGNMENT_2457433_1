                    My first thought for this website was, I want the user to feel at home and easily and simple browse through the website.
                    My first goal was simplicity, I want my website to only have necessary key icons that function and information, no extra text or images that will confuse the user.
                    My second goal was for the user to feel at home or simulate a feeling like they have been here before, the use of tea aesthetics is not only because I love tea, but tea is  calming and the use of the natural, warm colors I feel works with the idea of creating a homey feel without feeling like this is a tea website.
                    Last but not least, consistency and functionality, I was very consistent with the color scheme and text font and design so that each page can show how all content is linked and not the user off, I also made sure to use a pop up menu on pages after the home page because they consist of information that is important to the user and the pop up menu does not get in the way although it easily accessible.

                    The first rule of simplicity is keeping things organized and easy to access or read.
                    The homepage does not have a lot going on, it just consists of the title and pages the website consists, I want the user to easily direct their eyes to what options they have and go straight into the content, and a wallpaper to break the whitespace. 
                    The blog section is also laid out simply with a title and subtitle, then we have equal rows and columns of squares to neatly showcase the different content for different weeks. The squares contain the date of the blog, in chronological order, the title of the content of that week and a read more and read less button, because the square does not show all the writing or else we would have a situation looks taller or shorter than the other and making the page look untidy.
                    The design section has a lot of content, at first I thought of giving it a layout similar to the blog section but 1 it felt like a lot of work especially since I had images of wireframes and user flow diagrams, I thought that would need JavaScript beyond what I know so I will stick to the simple html with images . so, the design section is basically a scroll up and down.
                    The design section has the layout of the blog section showing the things I enjoy most. The reason behind these layouts is that it organizes my information and users can select easily which content from which week or title they want to feed from without scrolling or using the search bar.

My UI and UX designs have an impact on how my code is structured.
The layout of the UI has determined how the HTML code is organized and structured, with the use of HTML tags such as div, section, and body. This assists in having appropriate tittles and headings for my pages and content that goes with it. Similarly, the style of the UI will be reflected in the CSS code, with the use of CSS properties such as font size, background color, border-radius, media adjustability so that the website is responsive to any screen, and transformation of texts. 
The UX design also impacts the functionality of the website, which will in turn affect the code. For example, my UX design required the use of interactive elements such as buttons and icons to show more content and content, then the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code has been structured in a way that allows for this functionality. 
As much as all three languages work together to produce a magnificent website, I strongly believe in CSS because it enables you to lay out your UI and UX in a way that is organized and understandable for the user. 
And lastly, it is important the I link the three languages together so that they work simultaneously.
